# password_generator3000
A website that generates passwords.

## Description

This is a password generation site that took 2 days to complete. The pseudocode and variables were generated. With the assistance of a tutor, concatenating the strings was using the previously unkown operations of declaring empty strings [] and instead of utilizing the JavaScript concat method, used the =+ operation to "append" the strings. The utilizing a math random operation to store the variables of the global string to the length of the password choosen by the user, a password is generated. 

The style of the webpage adhere's to the mock up provided by the challenge documentation.
