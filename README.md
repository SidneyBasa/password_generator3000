# password_generator3000
A website that generates passwords.

## Description

This is a password generation site that took 2 days to complete. The pseudocode and variables were written first. With the assistance of a tutor, instead of concatenating the strings with the concact method, I use instead a previously unkown operation of declaring empty strings and then used the =+ operation to "append" the strings. The math random operation was used to select at random, characters from the full global string, to generate a new string that was the length of the password choosen by the user.

The style of the webpage adhere's to the mock up provided by the challenge documentation.

The starter code in the html and css files were provided by the UW Coding bootcamp.
